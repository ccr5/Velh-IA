### Description
This project is the environment of a scientific research called **Artificial Collective consciousness - Analysis of the Interactions between Artificial Intelligences**. 


### The Scientific Research 
The goal is analyze the interactions, behaviors and results of a multi-agent system with no objective, under an uncontrolled and unknown environment, applying sociological concepts.


It's divided in two points: 
1. Velh-IA: It's our reasearch environment. A tic-tac-toe game with two players: Statistical Algorithm and Multi-Agente System. It will be avaliable on website and mobile app to everybody watch.
2. Research: The article with all informations and results about what we get in Velh-IA


You can understand how it will works [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UKPZ7I5N6bp6ra51rSCFFoxtNL2clJYr/view?usp=sharing "here")

### Project Code
It has three microservice:
* velhia.api: Express project with all routes to save or get data. Use MongoDB
* velhia.game: Scripts, game control and all logic of this research.
* velhia.web: React website to tell about this project, follow the game and see analysis.

Each microservice has a readme document to explain how its works.
