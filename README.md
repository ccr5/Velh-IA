# Velh-IA

A New Way To Study, Learn and Have A Fun!

## Description

**Velh-IA** is a tic tac toe game where a statistical algorithmn (SA) and a proposed Multi Agent System (MAS) model compete to see who is the best. This aim of this repo is create an environment to a scientific research called **Artificial Collective consciousness - Analysis of the Interactions between Artificial Intelligences**.

### The Scientific Research

The aim of the scientific research is analyze the interactions, behaviors and results of a multi-agent system with no objective, under an uncontrolled and unknown environment, applying sociological concepts.

Velh-IA and [Ovomaltino](https://github.com/Ovomaltino/Ovomaltino) works together to figure out and develop a MAS model to achieve this goal. I invite you to read about it [here](https://www.fatecsaocaetano.edu.br/fascitech/index.php/fascitech/article/view/183/142) and understand how it works.

## Workflow

This project has two microservices:

- [velhia.api](https://github.com/ccr5/Velh-IA/tree/master/velhia.api#velh-ia-api): An API with all routes to save and get data.
- [velhia.game](https://github.com/ccr5/Velh-IA/tree/master/velhia.game#velh-ia-game): Scripts, game workflow and all logic of this research.

[![Environment](https://github.com/ccr5/Velh-IA/tree/master/docs/environment.png "Environment")](https://github.com/ccr5/Velh-IA/tree/master/docs/environment.png "Environment")

## Usage

### Debug
- We can see every event in velhia.game/logs
- You can use a IDE for MongoDB like Robo3T to data management
- You can connect with other system to data analytics or something else like PowerBI, Python ...

### Deployment

#### Docker
We provide docker images on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/ccr5) if you want to use it individually and a docker-compose to create all environment.
```
	docker-compose up
```
